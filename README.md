Primo Result Extender Aggregator Service 2 (PREAS2): User interface enhancement web service for ExLibris Primo.

This web service application was made to assist enhancements of the user interface in ExLibris Primo with data from various
external resources and Primo itself. It is possible to extend PREAS2 to test new ideas without too much of a hazzle.

This is a complete rewrite of the original PREAS available via EL Commons CodeShare. Support for mod_perl has been abandoned in
favor of the Perl Dancer Web Framework.
